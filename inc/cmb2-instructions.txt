Read Instalations

If including the library in your plugin or theme:

1. Place the CMB2 directory inside of your theme or plugin.

2.Copy (and rename if desired) example-functions.php into a folder above the CMB2 directory OR copy the entirety of its contents to your theme's functions.php file.

3. Edit to only include the fields you need and rename the functions (CMB2 directory should be left unedited in order to easily update the library).

4. Profit.

5. In plugin main file, ensure cab is included: require_once('inc/cmb2.php');
